# Accessible Refractor Horiseon

## Description 
This webpage provides information on Horiseon. This aim was to simplify the provided HTML and CSS code. Through this project, I developed my understanding of DRY codes, clear and concise titles, semantic HTML elements, logical structure, alt attributes for images and ordering heading elements. This task was completed using VS Code.

## Installation

To work on this code copy this SSH key: git@github.com:chelsea32568/accessible-refactor-horiseon.git and paste into your desired folder using Git Bash. Then use git pull to pull the file into your local repository. Make necessary changes and then add changes into the git repository by using git add -A, git commit -m "", git push. 

## Usage 

Read through the CSS and HTML files and look for opportunities to improve the code following practices such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). For example, the following CSS shows an example of where the CSS code has been simplified.  

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![Image of simplified CSS code](starter\assets\images\image.png)
```
